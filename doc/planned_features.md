#### Branch code and detection for KitchenSink
    Post 1.0
    Idea is to allow a way to formally declare which branches are being tested and to allow
    testing that we have hit all the branches we intended.
    Needs to have a nice method to declare various branches as not needing testing, or
    where several branches are covered by a single test.
